# pythonTabWriter
python stub to ease guitar tab writing

Use: \
* run with python main.py \
  * upon start, type how much "-" to insert each time you type a fret (i use 0 is valid) \
  * type the tab, valid exemples:

        
        initial       EADGBe      E2e2     noinput 
        status       produces   produces   produces
        e|-             0          2          -    
        B|-             0          -          -    
        G|-             0          -          -    
        D|-             0          -          -    
        A|-             0          -          -    
        E|-             0          2          -    
    
        U or u removes the last row (inserted or generated by the "timing" inserted on startup)

To do:
  - write to file
  - read to file
  - code not look like absolute dogshit
  - treat exceptions caused by invalid input from user
